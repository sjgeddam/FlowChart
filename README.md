# FlowChart README
## Contributions
**Aparna Krishnan**

**Madeline Huang**
* Splash screen & logos
* Main screen, including the 3 different screen scenarios and desing the user will encounter based off of their period start date, end date, and whether not the user is on their period.
* Upcoming dates on the main screen are relative to today's date if within 2 weeks (ex: today, tomorrow, next Thursday)
* Menu interactivity and animation

**Shannon Radey**

**Soujanya Geddam**
* Built storyboards for tracker screens including symptoms, mood, and flow 
* Added functionality (image switching) based on button selection (in mood and flow VCs); also added functionality for symptoms selection and designed table view to display symptoms aesthetically 
* Implemented core data for the screens to save user and date specific information (ex: flow level, mood type)

## Deviations
* Splash screen will not display random fun facts as it is unabled to be modified due to its nature
* Notifications will be implemented in the final instead of beta, as will the algorithm for predicting cycles
* Aesthetically pleasing UI is completed ahead of time
